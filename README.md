## SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction

### Introduction:
In this capstone, we will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX 
advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other 
providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can 
reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine 
the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against 
SpaceX for a rocket launch.
